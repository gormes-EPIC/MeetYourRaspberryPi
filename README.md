# Lab 2: Meet Your Raspberry Pi
## Objective

1. Install an operating system and set up your Raspberry Pi
2. Identify all the important components of a Raspberry Pi
3. Create a virtual Python environment for your Pi
4. Upload documents to GitHub using the browser
## You Will Need

- Raspberry Pi kit(Pi, power cord, microSD card) - *this will be your kit for the semester*
- External Keyboard - *please return at the end of class*
- External Mouse - *please return at the end of class*
- Micro HDMI to HDMI cable
- USB to SD card reader
- Raspberry Pi Imager - *this should be installed already on your computer*
- The bin that matches your computer number
## Part 1: Setting Up Your Pi Operating System

1. Follow these steps to get your Raspberry Pi set up: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#setting-up-your-raspberry-pi
2. When complete, you should get to the Pi's desktop
3. You should use the same username as your user account on your laptop for simplicity. If you need to write down your login information so you don't forget it, **please do that**.
4. Optional: Install VS Code with `sudo apt install code`. 
5. Once you are sure all of the hardware works, you are ready to move on to Part 2. Check in with me that your Pi is working before moving on.

_Every day that you use your Raspberry Pi, you are responsible for cleaning up all the components before you leave. This includes putting away the supplies you are using into your bin and returning all unused supplies to the shelves in the back._  

- [ ] Check in with Ormes before moving on.
## Part 2: Documenting your Raspberry Pi

1. Take a good quality picture of your Raspberry Pi from the top down
2. Using Google Drawings or Google Slides or another similar program, label all of the components of your Pi.
3. Create an Obsidian PDF to elaborate on each component and it's purpose
4. You may want to consult the official Raspberry Pi Documentation: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/

- [ ] Create a PDF with your diagram and explanation. 
## Part 3: Creating a Virtual Environment for Python

1. In order to install Python packages on your Pi, we will need to create **a virtual Python environment**. Sensors for the Pi require you to install third party Python packages that may interfere with each other. Creating a virtual environment allows you to easily revert to a clean version of Python in case that happens. Your Pi will give you a warning if you try to install packages not in a virtual environment and you will get the following error: 

```
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

    See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

2. Create a new folder for your Python scripts for this class. This can be anywhere on the Pi.
3. Open your terminal and change directory into your new directory.
4. Install the `venv` program with `sudo apt install python3-venv`
5. Then, create a new virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`. Now there should be a folder called `venv` inside your directory.
6. To activate your virtual environment, use: `source venv/bin/activate`. **You will need to do this every time you open the terminal so you may want to write this down. Remember to cd into the correct directory before trying to activate your environment.** 
	1. Optional: If you installed VS Code you can change your Python version in the application to your virtual environment. If you are having trouble with this please ask for help or see this [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments).
7. Try installing a package with `pip` for example `pip install cowsay` to test your set up. If set up correctly, this package should install without issue.

- [ ] pip install a package to test your installation.
## Part 4: Uploading to GitHub

1. Once you are all done, we are going to practice submitting documents by uploading them to GitHub. 
2. Navigate back to your repository. Click the `Add File` button next to the green `Code` button on the right side of the screen. Then, select your PDF to upload. Then click the `Commit` button to upload. Once you can see your PDF in the list of files at the top, you have uploaded it correctly. You can click on the PDF to view it in the browser. Then, return to Google Classroom and select "Mark as Done" for Lab 0.3. 

- [ ] Upload your PDF to GitHub and hit "Mark as Done" on Google Classroom. 

## Deliverables

- For part 1, let me know that you got into your Pi and all of the components function
- For part 2, create a PDF describing all of the components
- For part 3, create a virtual environment on your Pi
- For part 4, upload your PDF to GitHub.
